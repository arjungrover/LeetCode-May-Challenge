git init

git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new_repo

I use git@github.com:username/new_repo rather than https://github.com/username/new_repo, as the former is for use with ssh (if you set up ssh as I mentioned in “Your first time”, then you won’t have to type your password every time you push things to github). If you use the latter construction, you’ll have to type your github password every time you push to github.
