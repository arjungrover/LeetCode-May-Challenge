Example 1: Suppose the number is 12345 and k is 1. Now we can have below cases:
Remove 1 — Result will be 2345
Remove 2 — Result will be 1345
Remove 3 — Result will be 1245
Remove 4— Result will be 1235
Remove 5 — Result will be 1234
As you can see in this case we get the minimum number when we delete the last digit.
Now lets consider another example:
Example 2 : Suppose the number is 12145 and k is 1. Now we can have below cases:
Remove 1 — Result will be 2145
Remove 2 — Result will be 1145
Remove 1 — Result will be 1245
Remove 4 — Result will be 1215
Remove 5 — Result will be 1214
In this case we get the lowest digit if we remove 2 because the number next to it is smaller than 2.
After observing the two examples we can say that if all the digits are in increasing order than we will delete the last digit , otherwise we will delete a digit for which next digit is smaller.
Lets consider one more example to get a solid grasp of this:
Suppose the number is 10354 and k is 2 , that means we need to delete two digits.
We will start iterating the number and we will see that the number next to 1 is smaller than it. so we will remove 1.
Now the number becomes 0354. We will again start iterating it from 0.
3 is greater than 0 so move next
5 is greater than 3 so move next
4 is less than 5 so delete 5
Now the number will become 034. Keep in mind that before returning we need to remove all leading zeroes.
